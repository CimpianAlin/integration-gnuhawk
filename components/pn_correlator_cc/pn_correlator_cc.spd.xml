    <description>PN code sequential search correlator

Receives complex baseband signal, outputs complex correlation
against reference PN code, one sample per PN code period. The PN
sequence is generated using a GLFSR.

param: degree Degree of shift register must be in [1, 32]. If mask
             is 0, the degree determines a default mask (see
             digital_impl_glfsr.cc for the mapping).
param: repeat Set to repeat sequence.
param: mask   Allows a user-defined bit mask for indexes of the shift
             register to feed back.
param: seed   Initial setting for values in shift register.</description>
