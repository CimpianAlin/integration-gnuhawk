    <description>Map a stream of symbol indexes (unpacked bytes or shorts) to stream of float or complex onstellation points.in D dimensions ( D = 1 by default)


input: stream of int; output: stream of float

out[n D + k] = symbol_table[in[n] D + k], k=0,1,...,D-1

The combination of gr_packed_to_unpacked_XX followed by
gr_chunks_to_symbols_XY handles the general case of mapping
from a stream of bytes or shorts into arbitrary float
or complex symbols.</description>
