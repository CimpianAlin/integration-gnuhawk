    <description>A rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional decoder for the CCSDS standard

This block performs soft-decision convolutional decoding using the Viterbi
algorithm.

The input is a stream of (possibly noise corrupted) floating point values
nominally spanning [-1.0, 1.0], representing the encoded channel symbols
0 (-1.0) and 1 (1.0), with erased symbols at 0.0.

The output is MSB first packed bytes of decoded values.

As a rate 1/2 code, there will be one output byte for every 16 input symbols.

This block is designed for continuous data streaming, not packetized data.
The first 32 bits out will be zeroes, with the output delayed four bytes
from the corresponding inputs.</description>
