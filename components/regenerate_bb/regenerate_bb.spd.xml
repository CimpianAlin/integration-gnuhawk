    <description>Detect the peak of a signal and repeat every period samples

If a peak is detected, this block outputs a 1 repeated every period samples
until reset by detection of another 1 on the input or stopped after max_regen
regenerations have occurred.

Note that if max_regen=(-1)/ULONG_MAX then the regeneration will run forever.</description>
