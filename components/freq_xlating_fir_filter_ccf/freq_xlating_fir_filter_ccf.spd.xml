    <description>FIR filter combined with frequency translation with
gr_complex input, gr_complex output and float taps

This class efficiently combines a frequency translation
(typically &quot;down conversion&quot;) with a FIR filter (typically
low-pass) and decimation.  It is ideally suited for a &quot;channel
selection filter&quot; and can be efficiently used to select and
decimate a narrow band signal out of wide bandwidth input.

Uses a single input array to produce a single output array.
Additional inputs and/or outputs are ignored.

param: decimation set the integer decimation rate
param: taps a vector/list of taps of type float
param: center_freq Center frequency of signal to down convert from (Hz)
param: sampling_freq Sampling rate of signal (in Hz)</description>
