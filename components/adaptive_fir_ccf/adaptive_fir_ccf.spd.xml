    <description>Adaptive FIR filter with gr_complex input, gr_complex output and float taps

This is a base class to implement an adaptive FIR
filter. Generally, another block will inherit from this one to
build a new type of adaptive filter such as an equalizer.

This class implements two functions that are designed to be
overloaded by the child class: error(gr_complex out) and
update_tap(float tap, gr_complex in).

The error() function calculates the error value that will be
used to adjust the taps. The update_tap function then uses the
error and the input signal value to update a particular
tap. Typically, the error is calculated for a given output and
then this is used in a loop to update all of the filter taps in
a loop:

     d_error = error(sum);
     for(k = 0; k &lt; l; k++) {
       update_tap(d_taps[ntaps-k-1], in[i+k]);
     }

param: name Provides a name to identify this type of algorithm
param: decimation (interger) decimation rate of the filter
param: taps (real) filter taps</description>
