    <description>Implements a PLL which locks to the input frequency and outputs the
input signal mixed with that carrier.

input: stream of complex; output: stream of complex

This PLL locks onto a [possibly noisy] reference carrier on
the input and outputs that signal, downconverted to DC

All settings max_freq and min_freq are in terms of radians per sample,
NOT HERTZ.  The loop bandwidth determins the lock range and should be set
around pi/200 -- 2pi/100.</description>
