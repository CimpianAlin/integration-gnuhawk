    <description>A rate 1/2, k=7 convolutional encoder for the CCSDS standard

This block performs convolutional encoding using the CCSDS standard
polynomial (&quot;Voyager&quot;).

The input is an MSB first packed stream of bits.

The output is a stream of symbols 0 or 1 representing the encoded data.

As a rate 1/2 code, there will be 16 output symbols for every input byte.

This block is designed for continuous data streaming, not packetized data.
There is no provision to &quot;flush&quot; the encoder.</description>
