    <description>Detect the peak of a signal

If a peak is detected, this block outputs a 1,
or it outputs 0's.

param: threshold_factor_rise The threshold factor determins when a peak
            has started. An average of the signal is calculated and when the
            value of the signal goes over threshold_factor_rise*average, we
            start looking for a peak.
param: threshold_factor_fall The threshold factor determins when a peak
            has ended. An average of the signal is calculated and when the
            value of the signal goes bellow threshold_factor_fall*average, we
            stop looking for a peak.
param: look_ahead The look-ahead value is used when the threshold is
            found to look if there another peak within this step range.
            If there is a larger value, we set that as the peak and look ahead
            again. This is continued until the highest point is found with
            This look-ahead range.
param: alpha The gain value of a moving average filter</description>
