    <description>Detect the peak of a signal

If a peak is detected, this block outputs a 1,
or it outputs 0's.  

param: threshold_factor_rise The threshold factor determins when a peak
      is present. An EWMA average of the signal is calculated and when the
      value of the signal goes over threshold_factor_rise*average, we
      call the peak.
param: look_ahead The look-ahead value is used when the threshold is
      found to locate the peak within this range.
param: alpha The gain value of a single-pole moving average filter</description>
