    <description>Examine input for specified access code, one bit at a time.

input:  stream of bits, 1 bit per input byte (data in LSB)
output: stream of bits, 2 bits per output byte (data in LSB, flag in next higher bit)

Each output byte contains two valid bits, the data bit, and the
flag bit.  The LSB (bit 0) is the data bit, and is the original
input data, delayed 64 bits.  Bit 1 is the
flag bit and is 1 if the corresponding data bit is the first data
bit following the access code. Otherwise the flag bit is 0.
