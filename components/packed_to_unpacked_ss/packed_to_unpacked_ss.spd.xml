    <description>Convert a stream of packed bytes or shorts to stream of unpacked bytes or shorts.

input: stream of short; output: stream of short

This is the inverse of gr_unpacked_to_packed_XX.

The bits in the bytes or shorts input stream are grouped into chunks of
bits_per_chunk bits and each resulting chunk is written right-
justified to the output stream of bytes or shorts.
All b or 16 bits of the each input bytes or short are processed.
The right thing is done if bits_per_chunk is not a power of two.

The combination of gr_packed_to_unpacked_XX_ followed by
gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xf or gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xc handles the
general case of mapping from a stream of bytes or shorts into
arbitrary float or complex symbols.</description>
