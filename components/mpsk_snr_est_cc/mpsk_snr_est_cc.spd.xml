    <description>A block for computing SNR of a signal.

This block can be used to monitor and retrieve estimations of the
signal SNR. It is designed to work in a flowgraph and passes all
incoming data along to its output.

The block is designed for use with M-PSK signals especially. The
type of estimator is specified as the \p type parameter in the
constructor. The estimators tend to trade off performance for
accuracy, although experimentation should be done to figure out
the right approach for a given implementation. Further, the
current set of estimators are designed and proven theoretically
under AWGN conditions; some amount of error should be assumed
and/or estimated for real channel conditions.

param type: the type of estimator to use \ref ref_snr_est_types &quot;snr_est_type_t&quot; for details about the available types.
param tag_nsamples: after this many samples, a tag containing the SNR (key='snr') will be sent
param alpha: the update rate of internal running average calculations.</description>
