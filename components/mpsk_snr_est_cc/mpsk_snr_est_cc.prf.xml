    <description>Enum for the type of SNR estimator to select

Below are some ROUGH estimates of what values of SNR each of these
types of estimators is good for. In general, these offer a
trade-off between accuracy and performance.

 SNR_EST_SIMPLE:  Simple estimator (>= 7 dB)
 SNR_EST_SKEW:    Skewness-base est (>= 5 dB)
 SNR_EST_M2M4:    2nd &amp; 4th moment est (>= 1 dB)
 SNR_EST_SVR:     SVR-based est (>= 0dB)</description>
