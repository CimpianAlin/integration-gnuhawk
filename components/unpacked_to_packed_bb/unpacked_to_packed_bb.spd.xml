    <description>Convert a stream of unpacked bytes or shorts into a stream of packed bytes or shorts.
 
input: stream of unsigned char; output: stream of unsigned char

This is the inverse of gr_packed_to_unpacked_XX.

The low \p bits_per_chunk bits are extracted from each input byte or short.
These bits are then packed densely into the output bytes or shorts, such that
all 8 or 16 bits of the output bytes or shorts are filled with valid input bits.
The right thing is done if bits_per_chunk is not a power of two.

The combination of gr_packed_to_unpacked_XX followed by
gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xf or gr_chunks_to_symbols_Xc handles the
general case of mapping from a stream of bytes or shorts into arbitrary float
or complex symbols.</description>
