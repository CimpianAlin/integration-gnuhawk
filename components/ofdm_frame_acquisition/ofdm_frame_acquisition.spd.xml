    <description>take a vector of complex constellation points in from an FFT
and performs a correlation and equalization.

This block takes the output of an FFT of a received OFDM symbol and finds the 
start of a frame based on two known symbols. It also looks at the surrounding
bins in the FFT output for the correlation in case there is a large frequency
shift in the data. This block assumes that the fine frequency shift has already
been corrected and that the samples fall in the middle of one FFT bin.

It then uses one of those known
symbols to estimate the channel response over all subcarriers and does a simple 
1-tap equalization on all subcarriers. This corrects for the phase and amplitude
distortion caused by the channel.

param: occupied_carriers   The number of subcarriers with data in the received symbol
param: fft_length          The size of the FFT vector (occupied_carriers + unused carriers)
param: cplen		The length of the cycle prefix
param: known_symbol        A vector of complex numbers representing a known symbol at the
                                       start of a frame (usually a BPSK PN sequence)
param: max_fft_shift_len   Set's the maximum distance you can look between bins for correlation</description>
