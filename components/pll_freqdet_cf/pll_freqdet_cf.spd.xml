    <description>Implements a PLL which locks to the input frequency and outputs
an estimate of that frequency.  Useful for FM Demod.

input: stream of complex; output: stream of floats

This PLL locks onto a [possibly noisy] reference carrier on
the input and outputs an estimate of that frequency in radians per sample.
All settings max_freq and min_freq are in terms of radians per sample,
NOT HERTZ.  The loop bandwidth determins the lock range and should be set
around pi/200 -- 2pi/100.</description>
