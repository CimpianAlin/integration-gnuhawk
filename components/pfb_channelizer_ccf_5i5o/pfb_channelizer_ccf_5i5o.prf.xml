    <description>oversample_rate: (float) The over sampling rate is the
ratio of the the actual output
sampling rate to the normal
output sampling rate.  It must
be rationally related to the
number of channels as N/i for
i in [1,N], which gives an
outputsample rate of [fs/N,
fs] where fs is the input
sample rate and N is the
number of channels.</description>

    <description>the channel map. Channels are numbers as:

N/2+1 | ... | N-1 | 0 | 1 |  2 | ... | N/2
&lt;------------------- 0 -------------------->
                          freq

So output stream 0 comes from channel 0, etc. Setting a new
channel map allows the user to specify which channel in frequency
he/she wants to got to which output stream.

The map should have the same number of elements as the number
of output connections from the block. The minimum value of
the map is 0 (for the 0th channel) and the maximum number is
N-1 where N is the number of channels.

We specify M as the number of output connections made where M
&lt;= N, so only M out of N channels are driven to an output
stream. The number of items in the channel map should be at
least M long. If there are more channels specified, any value
in the map over M-1 will be ignored. If the size of the map
is less than M the behavior is unknown (we don't wish to
check every entry into the work function).

This means that if the channelizer is splitting the signal up
into N channels but only M channels are specified in the map
(where M &lt;= N), then M output streams must be connected and
the map and the channel numbers used must be less than
N-1. Output channel number can be reused, too. By default,
the map is [0...M-1] with M = N.</description>
