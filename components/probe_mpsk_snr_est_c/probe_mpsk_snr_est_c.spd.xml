    <description>A probe for computing SNR of a signal.

This is a probe block (a sink) that can be used to monitor and
retrieve estimations of the signal SNR. This probe is designed for
use with M-PSK signals especially. The type of estimator is
specified as the \p type parameter in the constructor. The
estimators tend to trade off performance for accuracy, although
experimentation should be done to figure out the right approach
for a given implementation. Further, the current set of estimators
are designed and proven theoretically under AWGN conditions; some
amount of error should be assumed and/or estimated for real
channel conditions.</description>
