    <description> Convert stream of bytes to stream of +/- 1 symbols

input: stream of bytes; output: stream of float

This block is deprecated.

The combination of packed_to_unpacked_bb followed by
chunks_to_symbols_bf or chunks_to_symbols_bc handles the
general case of mapping from a stream of bytes into arbitrary float
or complex symbols.

-> packed_to_unpacked_bb, unpacked_to_packed_bb,
-> chunks_to_symbols_bf, chunks_to_symbols_bc.</description>
